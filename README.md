## How do I complete this project?

1. Go to the [Javascript Basics course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud804) and select "View Course Materials."
2. Go through the videos and assignments in this course to learn the JavaScript necessary to build your resume.

***
### By the end:
My resume looks like this:

And my repository includes the following files:

* **index.html**: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the resume, including resumeBuilder.js.
* **js/helper.js**: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. It also has a few function shells for additional functionality. More on helper.js further down.
* **js/resumeBuilder.js**: This file is empty. You should write your code here.
* **js/jQuery.js**: The jQuery library.
* **css/style.css**: Contains all of the CSS needed to style the page.
* **README.md**: 
The GitHub readme file.
* and some images in the images directory.
